    <h2>Jamie's better than takeaway burger</h2>
    <p>This is the first meal I ever made with Paul. Usually we get takeaways or mum cooks, but this time I suggested we go to Countdown and get these ingredients.</p>
    <p>Instead of wedges we bought smiley faces, because we are two grown men. It was a blast and I think it's the start of a beautiful tradition.</p>
