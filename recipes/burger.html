    <h2>Jamie's better than takeaway burger</h2>
    <p>This is the first meal I ever made with Paul. Usually we get takeaways or mum cooks, but this time I suggested we go to Countdown and get these ingredients.</p>
    <p>Instead of wedges we bought smiley faces, because we are two grown men. It was a blast and I think it's the start of a beautiful tradition.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Buns</li>
        <li>Mince</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Red Onion</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Red Wine Vinegar</li>
